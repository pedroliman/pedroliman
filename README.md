👋 Hi, I’m Pedro Nascimento de Lima

Here are a few things about me:

- 🧑🏽‍💻 I'm an engineer at [RAND](https://rand.org), where I use models to inform policy decisions
- 📄 You can find my work at [pedrodelima.com](https://pedrodelima.com), at my [RAND profile page](https://www.rand.org/about/people/l/lima_pedro_nascimento_de.html) and at my [google scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=VOlVFVYAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate)
- 🤓 I like my models object-oriented and my research reproducible :)
